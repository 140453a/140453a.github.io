        "Spells in Memory: Bards, of either persuasion, can memorise INT/6 number of spells. They also gain the ability to memorise additional spells per rank for each spell rank below their current bardic rank.",

You possess fast reflexes and gain 1 extra Action Point, which may only be used to Parry or Evade. In addition, you may use the Evade skill to dodge a melee attack without falling prone. Against a ranged attack, you only end up prone if you fail the roll.",

You must perform for 2 consecutive Combat Rounds and then succeed at a skill roll with any of the following skills: Influence, Oratory, Musicianship, or Sing.

The effects of counter song will last 1 Scene and requires an Opposed skill roll of Sing or Musicianship versus an appropriate skill roll by the opponent. Counter song assumes you continue to perform throughout the full Scene. If successful, those within earshot (approx. 18 metres or 60 feet) are immune to audible enchantments.",

As long as you are Unburdened (ENC less than STRx2) and wearing nothing more restrictive than light armour, you may ignore 1 grade of difficulty to your Athletics roll when performing any attempt at climbing. In addition the Armour Penalty to Base Movement when climbing may be ignored.",

This Language skill consists of slang and implied meanings and is used between thieves as a way to discuss pursuits of an illicit nature in public, without giving away information to other interested parties.",
        "Vaulting: Using a pole at least two-thirds taller than you and moving at least at running or sprinting speed, you may vault over obstacles or up onto out-of-the-reach locations. This requires a successful Easy Acrobatics roll, and if successful, will allow you to vault horizontally up to twice your own height plus half the length of the pole. A successful vertical vault will allow you to reach heights equal to the length of the pole; however, vaulting vertically causes you to end up prone. A non-thief-acrobat that possesses the Acrobatics skill may attempt this feat at normal difficulty. On a critical success with a horizontal vault the distance vaulted may be increased by half again. A critical success while vaulting vertically allows you to land upon your feet."

# Mythras Classic-Fantasy Random Character Generator
### Info
This is a rank 1 character generator for the tabletop roleplaying game **Mythras Classic Fantasy**. The service produces a JSON object that can be imported by the Myhtras Roll20.net character sheet. Roll20 uses an importer, which I did not create, to transform specific JSON objects into human-readable character sheets to play with. Roll20 is the most popular service that TTRPG players use to play online. Its popularity has only increased during the Covid-19 pandemic. Thus, a large amount of players will find this service useful.

Mythras is similar to Dungeons & Dragons, but more complex and more obscure. This is a niche game that I personally do not play, but thought that it could use some help‚Äîas there is something special about supporting small communities.
